            <p>I haven't made videos about me playing ShellShock live. I have played it and can make videos about it if you want.</p>

        <h2>My youtube career</h2>
            <p>I started my youtube career in December 2015 with a video in Norwegian about how to download and install Forge to Minecraft. After that, I made some Piano Tiles 2 videos. In January 2016 I started a Hardcore mode survival Minecrat series. There I tested how long I could survive in hardcore mode. The series currently has only two videoes because I got some problems with my Minecraft launcher. I will continue (or start over if ou want) as soon as I can. In April 2016 I started a Lets Play series with the <a href="http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page">Lord of the Rings</a> mod.</p>
            <p>My videos is not that great beacuse I have a problem with the sound. I hope I get a microphone to my birthday in June, untill that, I have to use either my dad or mothers microphones or the Pc microphone.</p>
