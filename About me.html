<h2>My youtube carreer</h2>
<p>I started my youtube career in December 2015 with a norwegian video about how to download and install Forge to Minecraft. After that, I made some Piano Tiles 2 videoes. In January 2016 I started a Hardcore modesurvival minecrat series. There I tested how long I could survive hardcore mode. The series currently has only two videoes beacuse I got some problems with my Minecraft launcher. I will continue (or start over if ou want) as soon as I can. In April 2016 I started a Lets Play series with the <a href="http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page">Lord of the Rings</a> mod.</p>
<p>My videoes is not that great beacuse I use my PC microphone. I don't have a good microphone, so until I got that, my videoes will not have so great sound. I am wishing and hoping that I get a microphone to my birthday in Juny</p>
