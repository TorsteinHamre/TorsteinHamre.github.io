        <h3>Episode 2</h3>
    
            <p>This episode I recorded twice. The first recording didn't take up my voice, so I had to make a new video. I started using a mod called <a href="http://mods.curse.com/mc-mods/minecraft/242677-fastcraft">Fastcraft</a> that makesthe chunks update faster.</p>
