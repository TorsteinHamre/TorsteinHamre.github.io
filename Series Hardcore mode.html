        <h3>Why I started this</h3>
    
            <p>I started this as a challange about how long I could survive at hardcore mode in Minecraft. This was my first english series and the first english videoes at all.</p>

        <hr>
    
        <h3>Why did I stop?</h3>

            <p>I haven't published videoes in this series in a wile beacuse I have had some problems with my Minecraft launcher. I can't log in to the world. So until I can log in to Minecraft the normal way, it will not be created videoes. If you want me to start over, so will I do that after my <a href="Series%20Lets%20play%20LOTR.html">Lets play Lotr</a> series.</p>
